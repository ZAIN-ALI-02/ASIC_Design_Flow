## Chip Design Flow
A typical design flow follows a structure shown below and can be broken down into multiple steps. Some of these phases happen in parallel and some sequentially. We'll take a look at how a typical project design cycle looks like in the industry today.

## Execution

Create a design in any hardware descriptive language, after that follow these steps:

### 1. Creating Container

```
make mount
```

### 2. Initializing ASIC Flow

```
./flow.tcl -design <folder_name> -add_to_designs -init_design_config
```

### 3. Creating Design File

- Move to the folder `designs` containing `<folder_name>`.
- Open the file `config.json` and edit the details mentioned according to the design file.
- Move the folder `src` and create your design file in that folder.

### 4. Initiating ASIC Flow

```
./flow.tcl -design <folder_name> -tag first_run -interactive
```

#### Step 1: Synthesis

```
run_synthesis
```

#### Step 2: Floorplan
```
run_floorplan
```

#### Step 3: Placement

```
run_placement
```

#### Step 4: Clock Tree Synthesis

```
run_cts
```

#### Step 5: Routing

```
run_routing
```

#### Step 6: GDS Generation

```
run_magic
```

#### Step 7: Resistance Capacitance Extraction

```
run_rc
```

### 5. Exiting ASIC Flow

```
exit
```
