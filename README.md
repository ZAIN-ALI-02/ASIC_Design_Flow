## Chip Design Flow
A typical design flow follows a structure shown below and can be broken down into multiple steps. Some of these phases happen in parallel and some sequentially. We'll take a look at how a typical project design cycle looks like in the industry today.

## Execution

Create a design in any hardware descriptive language, after that follow these steps:

### 1. Creating Container

```
make mount
```

### 2. Initiating ASIC Flow

```
./flow.tcl -design <folder_name> -add_to_designs -init_design_config
```
